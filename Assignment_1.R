#Step 1 : Acquire the Dataset

#Step 2 : Refine the Dataset
#Correction of spelling mistakes
tsd <- tsd %>% rename(ID = Ã¯..ID)

#Selecting the important variable for statistic
tsd <- tsd %>% select(1:3, dtArrive, dtBegin, Sum, ServiceID, 17:20, DistanceTotal, RouteLength)

#Filter out the unwanted obeservations

#Q9: Are regular customers tends to choose specific car if yes then what average distance they travels using that car?

#Q11: What is the average time car driver takes to reach at suggested pickup points after customer placed the order?
avg_time_by_driver <- tsd %>% group_by(CarID) %>% summarise(avg_time = mean(time_to_reach)) %>% arrange(avg_time) %>% head(10)

#Q12: From which pick up points company gets customer who travels large distance?
